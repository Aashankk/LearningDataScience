touch .gitignore
This will create a gitignore file.

Add a file name in .gitignore file. It will ignore all the files with that name.

If you want to ignore all the files with the same extention eg .log just add *.log 

If you add /filename, it will ignore the file if it is presented in the git ignore folder.

You can add a whole folder to be ignored by adding the folder name ended by a / in the gitignore folder.

gitignore folder below.
1. assignment.html
2. *.log 
3. /assignment.html
4. foldername/
